Add a `#calculator` section with inputs for monthly invoices and average invoice amount plus a plan toggle, and output cards for monthly fee, days-to-cash improvement, and annual savings. Update navigation to link to the new section. Implement calculator logic in `public/script.js` with pure functions for fee/savings math, input listeners, and `aria-live` updates; persist last values in localStorage and restore on load. Extend `public/styles.css` with a responsive grid layout and clear input styling.
